# Diagramming System

## Does Obsidian play well with GraphViz DOT language?

``` dot
  digraph G {
    a -> b;
    b -> c;
  }
```

## How should this system of diagramming things with graphs work?

Anything that involves complicated systems or many dependencies should be diagrammed with a graph. The nodes of graphs should link to notes that describe them. As proficiency is gained over time, the time it takes to generate graphs should be reduced dramatically. Graphs should exist between paragraphs that explain them & give context.

## What improvements could be made?

- [ ] Experiment with different styles until one sticks.

- [ ] Are snippets working? Should we write some?
